    <p>
      The Holy communion is a secret time of felowship with the Lord, where
      believers remember or remind themselves of the supreme sacrifice of Jesus
      on the cross of calvary (1st Peter 1:18 & 19). The Holy communion is also
      known as the Lord's supper, Holy Eucharist or Holy sacrament. Holy
      communion is the center of the church life, (Mark 6:54), Everything we do
      in the church leads to the Eucharist and all things flow from it. It is
      the completion of all the church sacrament and the source, gold of the
      church doctrine and institution.
