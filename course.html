      It is a hidden truth. The communion is not exceptional, there is a mystery
      behind the Holy communion which the church should know and explore. The
      early church discovered and enjoyed it, they did not take the Lord's
      supper lightly. They were so particular about it as they broke bread daily
      both in the temple and in house to house (Acts 2:46). Holy communion is
      one vital tool we should be armed with and put to work or celebrate if we
      are to enjoy the many sided blessing Jesus paid for at calvary and made
      maximum impact in life of a christian.
